# EEG_scikit-learn

Application of Machine Learning Libraries from scikit-learn library to EEG data 

This code has a variaty of learning algorithms form the scikit-learn library including
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
* Decision Tree Learning
* Support Vector Machines
* Logistic Regression

In order to achieve dimentionality reduction the fallowing algorithms were used in combination
* Principal Componenet Analysis
* Independent Componenet Analysis
* t-SNE
* Spectral Embeddings
* Multidimentional Scaling
* ISOMAP
